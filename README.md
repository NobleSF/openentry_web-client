There isn't much yet.

## Development

```
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:dgellow/openentry_web-client.git
cd openentry_web-client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build everything
npm run build
# ... or automatically rebuild when a watched file has been changed
npm run watch
```

Local server (only for dev purpose). It will build everything, run a server, open a browser tab (thanks to browser-sync)

```
npm run browser
```
